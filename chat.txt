We are going to add a table under the scoring section that lists the previous throw scores. Each row will have:

I'll enhance the dice game by adding a history table that tracks previous throws and allows comments, with data stored in localStorage. Here's the updated code:

I've added a comprehensive history tracking system with the following features:

New Features:

History Table - Added below the scoring section that displays:
Throw number
Original score
-20% score
+20% score
Comment input field for each throw
localStorage Integration - All throw history is automatically saved to browser's localStorage:
When you throw dice, the scores are automatically added to history
Comments are saved when you type and press Enter or click away
History persists between browser sessions
History Management:
"Clear History" button to reset all records (with confirmation)
Empty state message when no history exists
Newest throws appear at the top of the table
Comment System:
Each throw has an input field for adding notes
Comments are saved automatically when you press Enter or click away
Visual feedback when comments are saved
Responsive Design:
Table adapts to smaller screens
Clean, consistent styling with the rest of the game
How It Works:

Every time you throw the dice, the scores are recorded in a new history entry
The history is stored in localStorage under the key "diceGameHistory"
You can add comments to any throw, and they'll be saved automatically
The history is loaded when you refresh the page or return later
You can clear the entire history using the "Clear History" button
The game now provides a complete experience with score tracking, persistent storage, and the ability to annotate your throws with comments.
